# Proxy Skeletal Mesh Creator

- Tool to create proxy geometry on any skeleton with the correct axis 
so it can be properly scaled.
- It also allows to exclude joints, base the geometry size on the joint 
length and radius, assign materials, and bind it using constraints or 
skin weights.
- Useful for animation previz, proxy rig LOD, and to better visualize the 
body parts' movement and weight.
